# Lightweight Django Application boilerplate

A lightweight Django project structure. Configuration and router are all contained inside `manage.py`.
For medium to large web apps, it is still advisable that you create separate apps/modules and add them to `INSTALLED_APPS` inside the configuration file.

Use this if you already know you way around the Django framework. If you are still learning, it is better that you use the conventional Django project structure.

## How to setup

1. Set environment variables

- `SECRET_KEY`

```
